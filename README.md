# Summer Analytics 2023 [IIT-Guwahati]
Summer Analytics 2023 was a Data Science Bootcamp organized by Consulting & Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati.

The course spanned over 6 weeks and was power packed with the concepts and fundamentals of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. The Capstone project (Week 6) and the Hackathon (Week 7) at the end enabled me to test the acquired skills hands-on. All the effort was worth it!
